I am a PhD candidate with the [Department of Software Science](https://sws.cs.ru.nl/) at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, under supervision of [Dr. Nils Jansen](http://www.cs.ru.nl/personal/nilsjansen/) and [Prof. dr. Marielle Stoelinga](https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~marielle/). As a researcher, I am part of [PrimaVera](https://primavera-project.com/), an academic consortium on the topic of predictive maintenance. Before starting my PhD in September 2020, I studied Industrial Engineering and Management at the University of Groningen, with a specialization in Smart Systems in Control and Automation.

Research Interests
------
My primary research interests are on the intersection between **Engineering**, **Systems & Control**, and **Formal Verification**. While physical systems in the world of engineering are continuous, most digital solutions are designed for discrete systems. Bridging the gap between these two domains is important to solve real-world problems with digital tools, and is a recurring topic in my research. Currently, I am working on **sequential decision making under uncertainty with correctness guarantees**, with applications to autonomous and robotics systems, predictive maintenance, and electrical power systems.
