abstract = {In upstream oil and gas production, flow measurement errors are common at multiple locations in the production system. These measurement errors lead to imbalances, which are reconciled by using allocation methods. The allocation method should redistribute the imbalance in a fair manner to all involved stakeholders. In this paper, data validation and reconciliation (DVR) is proposed as an alternative allocation method in multiphase production systems. DVR is a model-based optimization method that exploits redundancies in process data to minimize random measurement errors, and simultaneously provides a basis for the detection of gross errors. To study the applicability of DVR compared to conventional allocation methods, a model for generic multiphase production systems is developed, and the corresponding DVR problem is formulated. In order to deal with nonlinear flow effects (e.g. interphase mass transfer) the model is linearized around the operating conditions and the DVR problem is solved iteratively. From the simulation studies, it is concluded that DVR reduces measurement errors by up to 56% for gas allocation systems and 33% for multiphase systems. Gross errors in interior locations of the network can be located precisely, while allocating gross errors to exterior locations is generally not possible, due to limited network redundancy. Compared to conventional methods, DVR provides a better means for the detection of gross errors, and results in more accurate attribution of oil/gas ownership and more fair division of revenues between stakeholders.}
