Two papers accepted at CDC 2025! Both on advancing the theoretical foundations of abstraction-based policy synthesis for stochastic systems: one approach data-driven and the other model-based.

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15543">"Data-Driven Abstraction and Synthesis for Stochastic Systems with Unknown Dynamics"</a> with Mahdi Nazeri, Anne-Kathrin Schmuck, Sadegh Soudjani, and Alessandro Abate</li>
    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05062">"Probabilistic Alternating Simulations for Policy Synthesis in Uncertain Stochastic Dynamical Systems"</a> with Alessandro Abate</li>
</ol>
I look forward to participating in the world's leading control conference this December in Rio de Janeiro.
