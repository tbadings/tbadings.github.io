No more train delays, power outages, or failure of production machines? The [PrimaVera project](https://www.primavera-project.com/), funded by the Dutch National Research Agenda (NWA), represents a major step towards this goal. With predictive maintenance, or just-in-time maintenance (maintenance just before a system breaks down), the reliability of infrastructure and production resources can be increased and the costs of maintenance can be reduced.

I am involved as a researcher in Work Packages 3 and 4 of the PrimaVera project. In Work Package 3, we develop novel and automated methods to predict the future failure behavior of components and systems. In Work Package 4, we develop efficient and robust methods to use the predictions from Work Package 3 to make optimal maintenance decisions.
