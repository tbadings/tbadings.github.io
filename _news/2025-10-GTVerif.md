Excited to be an invited speaker at the [GT-Vérif 2025 annual meeting](https://www.lacl.fr/~youalhadj/gt-verif-2025.html) (Nov 5-7), hosted at Université Paris-Est - Créteil in Paris. Very much looking forward to share our latest work on control design of uncertain and stochastic systems with formal guarantees.
