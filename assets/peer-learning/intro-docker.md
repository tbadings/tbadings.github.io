## “But it works on my machine!”

Typical situation in research projects:

- Writing code for research projects
- Conda environment
- Python version (e.g. 3.12)
- Python packages (NumPy, Matplotlib, JAX, …)
- Other dependencies (C++ libraries, …)

You’re finished — how do you share with others?

- GitHub repository
- Installation instructions (many steps…)
- Different instructions depending on the OS, …

## What is Docker?

- A (free) tool to **package code + environment** into a single runnable unit
- Runs applications inside **containers** (isolated, lightweight environments)
- Same container runs **identically across machines**

### What problems does Docker solve?

- Let others run your code without complicated installation steps
- Dependency hell (conflicting Python, CUDA, library versions)
- Reproducibility over long time spans (months or years later)
- Easy archiving of code artifacts (often required by conferences)

## Docker vs. Virtual Machine

| Aspect | Virtual Machine (VM) | Docker |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| Operating system | Full operating system per VM | Uses the host OS kernel |
| Weight | Heavyweight | Lightweight |
| Isolation level | Hardware-level virtualization | Process-level isolation |
| Primary purpose | Designed to run different OS on single physical hardware | Designed to run applications in an isolated and reproducible environment |
| Resource allocation | Resources allocated up front | Resources used on demand |

## Docker Terminology

1. **Dockerfile**  
   File with instructions to create an image from

2. **Docker image**  
   Read-only (immutable) template used to create containers

3. **Docker container**  
   Runnable instance of an image

4. **Docker Hub**  
   Place to store, share, and manage container images

### Example Dockerfile

The following Docker file takes the Python 3.8 Docker image as its base, copies all the files (in the current working directory of the host), installs Python dependencies, and finally runs a command.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8

# set a directory for the app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# copy all the files to the container
COPY . .

# install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# define the port number the container should expose
EXPOSE 5000

# run the command
CMD ["python", "./app.py"]
```

## How I typically use Docker

During Python code development
- Develop locally (Conda environment)
- Store code on GitHub
- ReadMe with install instructions

Upon publication of a paper
- Source code on GitHub
- Create a Docker image with the precise code used to run experiments
- Archive this Docker image on Zenodo

## Install Docker

- Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/ 
- A simple tutorial: https://docker-curriculum.com/
- Do you see the following? Then, probably you didn’t start the Docker application

### First steps with Docker
Let's explore Docker a little bit by running our first container:

```docker run hello-world```

This command pulls the `hello-world` image and creates a container for it. If correct, you see the output generated by the container (which is, not surprisingly, "Hello World").

## Running web applications

I use the following template for my personal website: https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio

<img width="612" height="368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce91bb0c-c5f0-4bcd-8d6b-ac5dde22af77" />

This template can easily be deployed in a Docker container as follows. The first step is to clone the
