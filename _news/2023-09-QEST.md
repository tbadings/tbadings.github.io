In around two weeks, we will present our paper "[Formal Controller Synthesis for Markov Jump Linear Systems with Uncertain Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00679.pdf)" at QEST 2023 (September 20-22). Great collaboration with Luke Rickard, Licio Romao, and Alessandro Abate from the University of Oxford!`
