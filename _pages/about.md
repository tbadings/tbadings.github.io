I am a postdoctoral research associate with the [Oxford Control and Verification Group](https://oxcav.web.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, working with Prof. dr. Alessandro Abate.
Previously, I was a PhD student in the [Department of Software Science](https://sws.cs.ru.nl/) at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, under supervision of Dr. Nils Jansen and Prof. dr. Marielle Stoelinga. 
I defended my PhD thesis (*Cum Laude*, awarded to around 5% of PhD theses in the Netherlands) titled *[Robust Verification of Stochastic Systems: Guarantees in the Presence of Uncertainty](/assets/pdf/Badings_PhD_Thesis.pdf)* in March 2025.

I am a research associate in the [Erlangen AI Hub](https://erlangenhub.ox.ac.uk/) on the mathematical foundations of AI.
During my PhD, I was a member of [PrimaVera](https://primavera-project.com/), an academic consortium on the topic of predictive maintenance.

Research Goal
------

There is a quest for **reliable autonomy in control systems:** An autonomous drone must not crash under adverse weather, and a smart energy grid must remain stable despite fluctuating demand and supply. 
Growing complexity and uncertainty about systems and their environment have created a gap between the systems we *build* and the systems we can *reliably control*. 
My long-term research goal is to close this gap.

Achieving this goal requires reasoning about control decisions in systems. 
This reasoning uses, in particular, **dynamical systems** and **Markov decision processes.**
These models are studied across **control theory**, **formal methods**, and **artificial intelligence**. 
My research spans and has impact in all three communities.
